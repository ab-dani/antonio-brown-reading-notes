# HTML Lists 

1. When should you use an unordered list in your HTML document?
     - You should use it for a shopping list.
3. How do you change the bullet style of unordered list items?
     - Using the style property "list-style"
5. When should you use an ordered list vs an unordered list in your HTML document?
     - You should use an ordered list for things like a recipe. You should use an ordered list for things like a shopping list. 
7. Describe two ways you can change the numbers on list items provided by an ordered list?
     - Start attribute: This allows you to start a list from 1 all the way to finish.
     - You can edit it directly from CSS. 


# CSS The Box Model 

1. Describe the CSS properties of margin and padding as characters in a story. What is their role in a story titled: “The Box Model”?

   - In the box model, Padding is the main character who we get the most info in the beginning ThePaddingg is the secondary character who is the outer shell of the story. We don't know much about him but he helps out with the inner part of the story because he knows going on with Margin but Margin doesn't know. 

3. List and describe the four parts of an HTML elements box as referred to by the box model.

    **Content**
   - The most important part of the Box Model. It contains images, text, and other elements that can be measured by width and height.

   **Padding**

    - The space between the content and the border of the box. It affects the size of the content but nothing outside of the border. 
     
   **Border**
   - The area that surrounds the padding and content of the element. 
                                 
   **Margin**
   
   - Space around the border of the element. It creates a gap between the element and the rest of the elements surrounding it. 


# JS Arrays, Operators, Expressions, Conditions, and Loops

1. What data types can you store inside of an Array?

   - Integers, Characters, Strings, and Booleans
 
3. Is the people array a valid JavaScript array? If so, how can I access the values stored? If not, why?

          const people = [['pete', 32, 'librarian', null], ['Smith', 40, 'accountant', 'fishing:hiking:rock_climbing'], ['bill', null, 'artist', null]];
     - This is a legit array. You can access it by console.log([0 < Which is the number of the string in the array.])

   
5. List five shorthand operators for assignment in javascript and describe what they do.

**Assginment Operators** 

- A value being determind by two integers on the left and right. (Example adding two numbers to get a sum.)

     
**Comparison Operators**

- It compares operands and returns a logical value based on if it's true. 

**Logical Operators**

- They return with a boolean value such as || and &&  


**String Operators**

- Used to bring two string values together to make an operation

**Relational Operators**

- Comparing its operands, it returns a boolean value based on if it is true or not. 

7. Read the code below, evaluate the last expression, and explain the result and why.

- The answer would still be false because yes you may have added it in the parentheses. You still are multipplying it in the same place which would be false. 

9. Describe a real-world example of when a JavaScript program should use a conditional statement.

- Playing a short game like we did in Lab 3 where the user guesses what the number is and they have to keep trying until they get it right. Kinda like Sudoku or Chess.
        
10. Give an example of when a Loop is useful in JavaScript.
    - Let's say you have an array of 5 strings. The array of a string needs to list names in order. You could use a loop to get all of the names in order to get the names in order they need to go based on the exact string number the name it's in.
