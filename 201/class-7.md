## Explain why we need domain modeling.

**Clarity and Understanding** 
- Helps create clear understanding of the domain among stakeholders, such as devs, designers, and domain experts. 
**Problem Solving**
- You can break down complex problems into smaller, more manageable components. 
**Requirements Analysis**
- Helps identifying features, constraints, and buisness rules associated with a domain. 
**Design and Architecture**
- It helps define structure, relationships, and behavior of components within the system making sure it aligns with the real world domain. 
**Communication**
- It's crucial to communicate with domain experts and stakeholders. 
**Reusability**
- Domain models can be used over and over. They can be applied to different domains. 
**Testing and Validation**
- 
**Maintainability**
- A defined domain model can make software systems more maintainable. 
**Scalability**
- It can help plan for future scalability and expansion of systems.
**Data Management**
- Domain modeling aids in helping data is organized and stored to help the needs of the domain.

## Why should tables not be used for page layouts?

- Layout tables reduce accessibility for visually impaired users.
- Tables produce **Tag Soups** or confusion and difficulty coding.
- Tables are not automatically responsive. When you use tags such as divs and headers **they are only responsive to the size of the content.** 

## List and describe 3 different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML <table>.

- <col></col>
  - Defines a column within a table.
- <tr></tr>
  - defines a row on a table.
- <td></td>
  - defines the data on a table. 



## What is a constructor and what are some advantages to using it?

- It is a way to create objects with a specific structure and behavior.
- **Define the function with a capital letter as the name**
- **Add properties and Methods**
- **Create Instances**
- **Access Properties and Methods using Dot Notation**

## How does the term *this* differ when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor?

- In an object literal, *this* refers to the object that contains it.
- In a constructor function, *this* refers to a new object that is being created by the comstructor. *Constructor functions are typically used with the **new** keyword.



## Explain prototypes and inheritance via an analogy from your previous work experience.

- The blue print is a class of the luxury condo building as a class. It is the layout and structure of the building.
- Condo Units are the objects each with its own unique characteristics such as floor, layout, design, and resident.
- Inheritances are additional features like penthousesn that are added to the blue print with luxury features.
- Prototypes are like shared services that offer convience and accessibility like concierge services, pool and gym.
