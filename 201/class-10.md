## Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.
- Syntax errors **make the code not work at all.** Logic Errors are errors that **you won't notice because it technically work but it gives incorrect results.**
  
## List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.
- I have faced alot of Syntax errors and I talk to Thomas to get a better of the code I am typing. 
## How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?
- I will just grind it out because I need me to do better for myself. 
## How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?
- The Javascript Debugger is like a magnifying glass for your code. It helps you spot and fix mistakes in your programs. When you pause a vide, you examine the scene to check for anything unsual. This tool is the same way. 
## Define what a breakpoint is.
- A breakdown is like a bookmark in your code. It's a specific spot you choose where you want your want your program to pause or stop when it's running. 

## What is the call stack?
- A call stack is like a stack of books. When you open a book **(call a function)** you pull it on top of the stack. You read the top book **(run the function)** and when you are a done, you remove it from the stack. You keep doing this until there are no more books in the stack **(functions in your code)**. The call stack keeps track of which book **(function)** you're reading at any given time.
