1. How would you describe an object to a non-technical friend you grew up with?
   - It iS like a magical box where you can create fun animations and do other cool stuff. It's almost like the box from Dragon Tales, you can put different variables in and make wishes to make things come true. 


3. What are some advantages of creating object literals?
  - Object literals in JavaScript offer simplicity, readability, flexibility, and organization. 

4. How do objects differ from arrays?
   - Arrays are ordered lists accessed by number indices. Objects are key-value pairs accessed by keys. Array are for ordered data while objects are better for organizing data with specific identifiers. 


6. Give an example of when you would need to use bracket notation to access an objectâ€™s property instead of dot notation.
   - You would need to use bracket notation to access an object's property name that contains special characters, spaces, or starts with a number. This is what it will look like...

  
   - const myObject = {"property-name": "I am accessed using bracket notation!" _The right way to do it._ _This is an object with a property name containing special characters_
   - _Accessing the property using dot notation won't work in this case_ console.log(myObject.property-name); _Syntax error!_
   - console.log(myObject["property-name"]); _The right way to do it._
     


8. Evaluate the code below. What does the term this refer to and what is the advantage to using this?



9. What is the DOM?


10. Briefly describe the relationship between the DOM and JavaScript.
