## Explain why we need domain modeling.

**Clarity and Understanding** 
- Helps create clear understanding of the domain among stakeholders, such as devs, designers, and domain experts. 
**Problem Solving**
- You can break down complex problems into smaller, more manageable components. 
**Requirements Analysis**
- Helps identifying features, constraints, and buisness rules associated with a domain. 
**Design and Architecture**
- It helps define structure, relationships, and behavior of components within the system making sure it aligns with the real world domain. 
**Communication**
- It's crucial to communicate with domain experts and stakeholders. 
**Reusability**
- Domain models can be used over and over. They can be applied to different domains. 
**Testing and Validation**
- 
**Maintainability**
- A defined domain model can make software systems more maintainable. 
**Scalability**
- It can help plan for future scalability and expansion of systems.
**Data Management**
- Domain modeling aids in helping data is organized and stored to help the needs of the domain.
